# What is maintainable software?

<v-clicks>

- Future-reader-focused
- Easy to read
- Easy to understand
- Easy to change
- Consistent style and implementation

</v-clicks>

# Considerations

<v-clicks>

- Guidelines, not rules
- Lots of exceptions

# Naming

# Naming

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Bad names can slow you down
- Good names (in combination with accurate types) can almost take away the need to actually read the code
- A bit of effort goes a long way
  - You can _always_ do better than single-letter variables like `x` or `i`
- Meaningful
- Pronounceable
- Long-ish names are OK
  - Leverage your IDE's autocomplete for longer names, we don't use punchcards like in the 60s

# Functions

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Ideally small
- Minimal responsibility
  - Ideally does one thing, and does it well
- Named based on what it does

</v-clicks>

<h2 v-click>Benefits</h2>

<v-clicks>

- Easier to test
- Easier to understand how they work
- Easier to compose together
- Easier to change
- Easier to detect a bloated function
- A well-named function can often replace a comment

# Nested Control Structures

<<< @/snippets/nested-control-structures-good.ts {hide|1|3-8|10-15|17-20|22|all}

---

# Nested Control Structures

<v-clicks>

- Avoid overly-nested control structures (i.e. less indentation is better)
- Destructure values that are used more than once
- Split out and name conditional logic
- Use early `return`s to handle branches

# Switch Statements

---

# Switch Statements

<v-clicks>

- Easy to forget `break` or `default` case (TypeScript can help)
- Fall through logic can be risky, harder to understand
- Not bad maintainability for small number of cases
- Maintainability does not scale well as more cases are added

</v-clicks>

<h2 v-click>Data-driven Mapping</h2>

<v-clicks>

- Data is not coupled to mapping function
- Types are not coupled to mapping function
- Easier to add/remove/change a mapping

# Too Many Function Parameters

<<< @/snippets/too-many-function-parameters.ts {hide|1|1-3|1-5}

---

# Too Many Function Parameters

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Function is doing more than one thing
- Harder to interpret at a glance
- Readers more likely to ignore long lists
- Types can help, but don't fix the problem
  - E.g. two `boolean` parameters in a row

</v-clicks>

# Comments

# Comments

<v-clicks>

- Ideally none (unrealistic)
- No need to comment every line
- Can provide valuable information, but can quickly become stale
- Writing is hard!

</v-clicks>

---
layout: center-code
---

# Comments - Explain With Code

# Comments - TODOs and Context

<<< @/snippets/comments-todos-and-context.ts {hide|1|3-7|8-9|all}

---

# Reasons to Leave a Comment

<v-clicks>

- Unexpected/non-standard implementation/decision
- Reasoning for one approach over another
- Something is hard to understand at a glance and can't be simplified (regex)
- Link to a formal specification that you're adhering to
- Link to github issue for a bug/workaround

</v-clicks>

# Commented Code

<<< @/snippets/commented-code.ts {hide|all}

---

# Commented Code

<v-clicks>

- Fine temporarily, just don't commit it
- Bloats files
- If it's committed, just delete it, it can be recovered (that's the point of version control)
- If it's _not_ committed and you're worried about losing it, commit it and then delete it

</v-clicks>

# Structure

---

# File and Line Length

<v-clicks>

- Line length limits are a thing of the past
- Code formatting tools help ensure lines don't get too long
- The contents of a file should be related to the name of the file
- Generic names like `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, become dumping grounds for shared functions
- Group shared code by their function, e.g. `formatters.ts`, `validators.ts`
- Large files can signal an opportunity to split things up

</v-clicks>

layout: center-code

# Proximity Implies Association

<<< @/snippets/proximity-implies-association.ts {hide|1-5|7-8|all}

---

# Whitespace

<v-clicks>

- Very much a personal preference
- Code formatting tools get you 90% of the way there
- IMO newlines are very underrated in their effect on readability

# Tooling

---

# Code Formatters

<v-clicks>

- Formats your code according to specific rules
- Enforce consistent style
- Consistency trumps personal preference
- In the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is the commonly used code formatter

</v-clicks>

# Code Formatters

<<< @/snippets/code-formatters.ts {hide|all}

# Linters

<v-clicks>

- Reports warnings and errors on specific code patterns
- Enforce certain syntax patterns
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) common in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- Identify code smells
- Prevent footguns
- Can automatically fix some issues

</v-clicks>

# Git and GitHub

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Commit early, commit often
- Past PRs contain tons of context and learnings
- Keep PRs focused and small if possible
  - Split up large changes into smaller PRs
  - No rule that says you have to do 1 PR per Jira card/item of work
  - [Insert anecdote here]
- Review your own PR (even before you open it!)
  - Helps catch silly mistakes/oversights
  - Helps gauge whether or not your changes should be split up into multiple PRs
- Add comments to your own PRs (try and pre-empt your reviewer's questions)
- GitHub search is super useful for finding examples/inspiration (both in SEEK repos and external
  repos)
